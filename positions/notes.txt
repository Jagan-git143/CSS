Static: by default, every element contains "static" position and it will not have any impact of top, left, right, bottom

position:absolute will move the elements based on body, it consider top,left,right,bottom,with respect to  body

fixed: it will move the element based on body , it considers top,left,lright,bottom with repect to body but scrolling will not have any impact on these elements
